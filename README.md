## Why 'davaiops'?
'davai' is kind of a neat word with multiple meanings, depending on context. Directly translated it just means 'give' (singular imperative for all the other language nerds). Sometimes it can mean 'bye', other times kind of like "let's". From a non-native speaker's perspective, its usage can get pretty creative. In this context, however, the intent is to mean something like "ok, let's do it". The 'ops' part is meant to suggest that the activities involve devops in some form since I'm both performing the task of software development, as well as deploying, monitoring, maintaining infra, etc... 

I chose both words in part because of the flexibility in both of their meanings, but ultimately, it's just an obscure name that I came up with and luckily the domain was cheap and available. 

I'll note that I'm not a native Russian speaker (where `давай` originally comes from), nor am I a native Estonian speaker (where I first picked up the usage). The above info - and my intepretation of it - are primarily from observations from native speakers. There might be a few things I've gotten wrong with its interpretation. If so, I'm happy to be corrected on that - feel free to reach out!
